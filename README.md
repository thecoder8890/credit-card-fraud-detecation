# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Notebook Summary

## Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. Detecting fraud benefits both banks and their customers by minimizing financial losses and building trust. The dataset used contains transactions made by European cardholders over two days in September 2013. It is highly imbalanced, with only about 0.172% of the transactions labeled as fraud.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow consists of the following key steps:

1. **Reading, Understanding, and Visualizing Data**
    - Load the dataset and review its structure.
    - Display initial rows and basic statistics to get an overview.

2. **Data Preparation for Modeling**
    - Check for and handle missing data.
    - Prepare feature variables and target labels for model training.

3. **Model Building**
    - Train machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

4. **Model Evaluation**
    - Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Key Actions and Code Snippets

- **Library Imports**
    - Essential libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) are imported for data handling and visualization.
    - Warnings are suppressed for clarity.

- **Data Loading**
    - The dataset (`creditcard.csv`) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
    - The first few rows are displayed to inspect columns and sample data.

- **Data Inspection**
    - The shape and structure of the DataFrame are checked (284,807 rows Ã— 31 columns).
    - The `info()` method is used to confirm data types and check for missing values.

- **Statistical Summary**
    - Descriptive statistics are generated for all features, showing values like mean, standard deviation, min, and max for each column.

- **Missing Values Check**
    - All columns are checked for missing values, and none are found.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Initial analysis focuses on the distribution of data and identifying anomalies.
- Most columns are anonymized (`V1` to `V28`), with `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class` being meaningful.
- The target variable is `Class`: `1` for fraud, `0` for legitimate transactions.

---

## Preparation for Modeling

- Display options are set for full visibility of columns.
- The data is readied for further processing, such as feature engineering and model training.

## TL;DR

This notebook covers the early stages of a credit card fraud detection project: loading and inspecting a real-world, imbalanced dataset, confirming data integrity, and preparing for model development to classify transactions as fraudulent or not.
